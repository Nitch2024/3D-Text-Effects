![Example](https://github.com/Nitch2024/3D-Text-Effects/blob/main/3D%20Example.png)

# Reproducing look and feel of textstudio.com
- Roughly based on [Super preset from textstudio.com](https://www.textstudio.com/logo/super-text-effect-2187)
- The rendering does not match 100%, mostly eye balled
- CSS rendering is a pure academic exercise not meant to be used but shared in case it helps others
- Canvas rendering is more useful and can be saved as an image

# Very limited
- Most logic and values have been hard-coded
- Many 3D text effects available on textstudio have not been reproduced
- Not optimized
